# pythonWater_Sprinkler
Creating a program, in Python, which will first scraping and parsing a weather website.
Second, the program will use this information to determine if my home sprinkler system needs to be turned on, halfway-on, or turned off dependent on the forecast.
I am planning on also building an Arduino powered Sprinkler System to run this and have the Python program control and send instructions to daily.
(I may need to change the Arduino to a lower powered Raspberry Pi depending on complexity and needs as this project continues)
